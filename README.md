# master-thesis
This repository contains the code for my master thesis on keystroke dynamics, where I will be combining periodic and continuous authentication systems. This is not really a development project, but rather a research project. The code is needed to generate data for analysis, which is the main focus of the project. The goal is to see if extending a continuous authentication (CA) system with a periodic authentication (PA) system can improve the CA systems performance.
